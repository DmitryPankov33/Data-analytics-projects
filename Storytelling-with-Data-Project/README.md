# Storytelling with Data: Analyzing and Monitoring Returns

**Project Overview**:
In this project, I analyzed return rates at a retail store to find root causes and created a dashboard to monitor returns. The goal was to build an effective storytelling arc to communicate findings and recommend actionable insights.

## Project Description:

### 1. What is Causing Returns?
- Built several visualizations to analyze return rates by product subcategory, customer, geography, and time to identify the root causes of returns.
- Created composite charts to explore the impact of multiple factors on return rates.

### 2. Building a Dashboard for Monitoring Returns
- Designed and developed a dashboard to monitor returns, including low-fidelity mock-ups and a final Tableau dashboard with key visualizations.
- The dashboard allows users to filter data and drill down into specific areas of interest to identify patterns in returns.

### 3. Presenting Your Analysis and Dashboard
- Constructed a story arc for the presentation of the findings, summarizing key insights on return rates and demonstrating how to use the dashboard to drive decision-making.
- Delivered a 3-5 minute screen recording to present the story and the dashboard in action.

*This project was completed as part of the Storytelling with Data module in my Data Analytics course.*
