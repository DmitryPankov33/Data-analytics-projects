# Squirrel Study Project

**Project Overview**:  
In this project, I recreated a figure using a dataset from a mock study on squirrel diets. The goal was to use either Seaborn or Plotly to closely replicate a provided figure, matching the title, axis labels, legend, and data presentation.

## Project Description:

### 1. Dataset
- **`squirrel_diet.csv`**: Contains data on 100 red squirrels given one of three different diets after weaning, with their full-grown adult weights recorded.

### 2. Visualization Task
- **Figure Recreation**: The task was to recreate a specific figure using the provided dataset. The figure included:
  - Title and axis labels
  - Axis ticks and ranges
  - Legend with magenta and green data points
  - Grouping and presentation of data points
  
### 3. Tools and Techniques
- **Libraries Used**: I used Seaborn and/or Plotly for the visualization, exploring various functions and parameters to closely match the given figure.
- **Customization**: While the core elements of the figure were recreated to match the original, I also explored additional customization options like font size, style, and image size.

*This project was completed as part of the Data Visualization with Python module in my Data Analytics course.*
