# SuperStore: Data Visualization with Tableau

**Project Overview**:  
The SuperStore is facing significant financial challenges. As a consultant, my task was to analyze its operations and identify strategies to increase profitability and avoid bankruptcy. The project involved visualizing key metrics to answer critical business questions.

## Project Description:

### Part 1: Profits & Losses
- Identified the biggest profit centers and loss-makers across different dimensions (e.g., subcategory + region).
- Recommended which products the superstore should stop selling.
- Highlighted subcategories to focus on and those to stop selling (three each).

### Part 2: Advertising
- Determined the best states and months for advertising, focusing on return on ad spend.
- Visualized the average profit per month for the top 3 states and suggested advertising budgets based on profit margins.

### Part 3: Returned Items
- Analyzed product and customer return rates by visualizing the highest return rates.
- Created a visual comparison of profit vs. return rate to recommend whether the superstore should continue or cease business in specific dimensions (e.g., state, shipping mode, product type).
