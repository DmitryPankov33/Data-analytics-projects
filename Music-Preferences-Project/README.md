# Music Preferences Project

**Project Overview**:
This project was one of my early training exercises in data analysis, completed during the Python Fundamentals module. The goal was to compare the music preferences of two cities—Springfield and Shelbyville—using real Yandex.Music data. It provided foundational experience in data analysis with Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

We tested the following three hypotheses:

1. User activity differs depending on the day of the week and from city to city.
2. On Monday mornings, Springfield and Shelbyville residents listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday evenings.
3. Springfield and Shelbyville listeners have different preferences. In Springfield, they prefer pop, while Shelbyville has more rap fans.

**Dataset**:
The dataset includes user information such as the track played, the artist, genre, city, and the exact time of play.

**Summary of Findings**:
- **Hypothesis 1**: User activity in Springfield and Shelbyville depends on the day of the week, though the cities vary in different ways. This hypothesis is fully accepted.
- **Hypothesis 2**: Musical preferences do not vary significantly over the course of the week in both Springfield and Shelbyville. Pop music is the most listened-to genre in both cities. Therefore, this hypothesis is not accepted. It's important to note that missing values may have affected the result.
- **Hypothesis 3**: The musical preferences of users from Springfield and Shelbyville are quite similar. This hypothesis is rejected, as any differences in preferences are not evident from this data.

**Notebook**:
The full analysis, including code and visualizations, is available in the Jupyter Notebook: [Music Preferences Project Notebook](./Music%20preferences%20project.ipynb).

*This project was completed as part of the Python Fundamentals module in my Data Analytics course. It served as an introductory exercise to build my foundational skills in Python and data analysis.*
