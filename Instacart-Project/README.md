# Instacart Shopping Project

### Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and cleaning a modified dataset from Instacart, a grocery delivery platform. The goal is to gain insights into the shopping habits of Instacart customers by cleaning the data, handling missing and duplicate values, and performing various analyses to answer specific questions.

### Key Objectives
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Verify and correct data types.
   - Identify and handle missing values.
   - Detect and remove duplicate entries.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Explore shopping patterns by analyzing the distribution of orders across different hours of the day and days of the week.
   - Investigate customer behavior, including the frequency of reorders and the typical number of items per order.
   - Identify the most frequently ordered products and analyze customer preferences.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of the following files:
- **`instacart_orders.csv`**: Contains information about individual orders.
- **`products.csv`**: Details of the products available on the platform.
- **`aisles.csv`**: Information about the aisles in which products are located.
- **`departments.csv`**: Department information for the products.
- **`order_products.csv`**: Links orders to the products purchased.

### Notebook
The full analysis, including code and visualizations, is available in the Jupyter Notebook: **Instacart Project Notebook**.

*This project was completed as part of a course focused on data analysis and preprocessing techniques using real-world datasets.*
