# Instacart Shopping Data Analysis

**Project Overview**:
In this project, I analyzed and cleaned a modified dataset from Instacart, a grocery delivery platform. The goal was to gain insights into the shopping habits of Instacart customers by handling missing and duplicate values, verifying data types, and performing various analyses to answer specific business questions.

**Notebook**:
The full analysis, including code and visualizations, is available in the Jupyter Notebook: [Instacart Project Notebook](./Instacart%20Project.ipynb).

## Key Objectives:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Verified and corrected data types.
   - Identified and handled missing values.
   - Detected and removed duplicate entries.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Explored shopping patterns by analyzing the distribution of orders across different hours of the day and days of the week.
   - Investigated customer behavior, including the frequency of reorders and the typical number of items per order.
   - Identified the most frequently ordered products and analyzed customer preferences.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of the following files:
- **`instacart_orders.csv`**: Contains information about individual orders.
- **`products.csv`**: Details of the products available on the platform.
- **`aisles.csv`**: Information about the aisles in which products are located.
- **`departments.csv`**: Department information for the products.
- **`order_products.csv`**: Links orders to the products purchased.

*This project was completed as part of a course focused on data analysis and preprocessing techniques using real-world datasets.*
