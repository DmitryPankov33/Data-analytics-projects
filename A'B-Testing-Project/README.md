# A/B Testing Project: Optimizing Online Store Revenue

**Project Overview**:  
In this project, I prioritized hypotheses using the ICE and RICE frameworks and analyzed A/B test results to optimize an online store's revenue. The goal was to identify the most impactful hypotheses and evaluate their effectiveness through A/B testing.

## Project Description:

### 1. Prioritizing Hypotheses
- **Task**:
  - Applied the ICE and RICE frameworks to prioritize nine hypotheses from the `hypotheses_us.csv` dataset.
  - Compared the results of ICE and RICE, explaining the changes in prioritization.

### 2. A/B Test Analysis
- **Task**:
  - Analyzed cumulative revenue, average order size, and conversion rates by group.
  - Examined user behavior through scatter plots of orders per user and order prices.
  - Calculated statistical significance for conversion rates and order sizes using raw and filtered data.
  - Made recommendations based on the A/B test results, including whether to continue or stop the test.

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendations
- **Outcome**: Provided insights on the most promising hypotheses and offered data-driven recommendations based on the A/B test analysis.

*This project was completed as part of the A/B Testing module in my Data Analytics course.*
