# Software Development Tools: Car Sales Web Application

**Project Overview**:  
In this project, I enhanced my software engineering skills by developing and deploying a web application using a car sales advertisements dataset. The web app includes interactive visualizations for data analysis and is accessible via a cloud service.

## Project Description:

### Key Features:
- **Web Application**: Developed with Streamlit to display car sales data interactively.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights from the dataset.
- **Visualizations**: Created histograms and scatter plots using Plotly and Altair.
- **Interactivity**: Implemented interactive features, such as checkboxes, to allow users to explore the data.

### Dataset:
- **`vehicles_us.csv`**: Contains data on car sales advertisements, used for analysis and visualization.

### Project Structure:
- **`app.py`**: Main application file for the Streamlit web app.
- **`notebooks/EDA.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis.
- **`.streamlit/config.toml`**: Configuration file for Streamlit deployment.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python packages required for the project.

*This project was completed as part of a course focused on developing software engineering skills and building web applications with real-world datasets.*
