# Software Development Tools: Project

### Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing software engineering skills by developing and deploying a web application using a car sales advertisements dataset. The web app is accessible via a cloud service and includes interactive visualizations for data analysis.

### Key Features
- **Web Application**: Developed with Streamlit to display car sales data interactively.
- **Data Analysis**: Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights from the dataset.
- **Visualizations**: Features histograms and scatter plots created using Plotly and Altair.
- **Interactivity**: Users can interact with the data through checkboxes and other Streamlit components.

### Dataset
- **`vehicles_us.csv`**: Contains car sales advertisements data used for analysis and visualization.

### Deployment
- The application is deployed on Render and can be accessed [here](https://project-da7z.onrender.com/).

### Project Structure
- **`app.py`**: Main application file for the Streamlit web app.
- **`notebooks/EDA.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis.
- **`.streamlit/config.toml`**: Configuration file for Streamlit deployment.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python packages required for the project.

*This project was completed as part of a course focused on developing software engineering skills and building web applications with real-world datasets.*
