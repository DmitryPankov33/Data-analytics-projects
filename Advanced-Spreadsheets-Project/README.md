# Advanced Spreadsheets Project

**Project Overview**:
I was tasked with analyzing the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City. The client, a real estate investor, needed insights into which types of properties to target for investment based on current Airbnb data.

## Key Objectives:
1. **Data Exploration**: Reviewed and cleaned the NYC Airbnb dataset, including filtering listings that are inactive or not relevant to the analysis.
2. **Neighborhood Analysis**: Identified the top 10 neighborhoods in Manhattan with the highest rental activity based on recent reviews.
3. **Property Size Analysis**: Analyzed property sizes to determine the most popular vacation rental types across different neighborhoods.
4. **Occupancy Rate Calculation**: Estimated occupancy rates using Airbnb calendar data and created pivot tables to calculate average occupancy rates for various listings.
5. **Revenue Estimation**: Calculated potential annual revenue for investment properties based on rental prices and occupancy rates.

## Insights & Recommendations:
- Neighborhoods like Harlem and West Village have the highest rental activity.
- Studio apartments and 1-bedroom properties are the most popular vacation rentals in these areas.
- Properties with high occupancy rates and good reviews tend to generate the highest revenue.
