# SuperStore: Data Visualization with Tableau

**Project Overview**:
The SuperStore is facing significant financial challenges. As a consultant, my task was to analyze its operations and identify strategies to increase profitability and avoid bankruptcy. The project involved visualizing key metrics to answer critical business questions.

## Project Description:

### Part 1: Profits & Losses
- Identify the biggest profit centers and loss-makers across different dimensions (e.g., subcategory + region).
- Recommend which products the superstore should stop selling.
- Highlight subcategories to focus on and those to stop selling (three each).

### Part 2: Advertising
- Determine the best states and months for advertising, focusing on return on ad spend.
- Visualize the average profit per month for the top 3 states and suggest advertising budgets based on profit margins.

### Part 3: Returned Items
- Analyze product and customer return rates by visualizing the highest return rates.
- Create a visual comparison of profit vs. return rate to recommend whether the superstore should continue or cease business in specific dimensions (e.g., state, shipping mode, product type).
